					<p style="font-size:17px">Floatstreet is pleased to offer a short-term liquidity product earning investors annualized target interest payments of 3.5% over its 90-day term. Yieldstreet offers a potential mutual advantage to both originators and investors by fully prefunding upcoming offerings that will launch on the Yieldstreet platform. From the originator’s perspective, prefunding helps to eliminate execution risk for the transaction as 100% of funds are available at the time of closing. For investors, prefunding an investment offering means that any participating investors can begin to earn interest as soon as their allocation goes active, regardless of whether the rest of the investment has been fully allocated. Yieldstreet will also invest in this Short Term Note offering alongside its investors and take a first loss position, ultimately demonstrating its alignment of interests with investors.</p>
