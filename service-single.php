					<h2 class="h2-ow">Overview</h2>
					<p class="overview-txt">Floatstreet is pleased to offer a short-term liquidity product earning investors annualized target interest payments of 3.5% over its 90-day term. Floatstreet offers a potential mutual advantage to both originators and investors by fully prefunding upcoming offerings that will launch on the Floatstreet platform. From the originator’s perspective, prefunding helps to eliminate execution risk for the transaction as 100% of funds are available at the time of closing. For investors, prefunding an investment offering means that any participating investors can begin to earn interest as soon as their allocation goes active, regardless of whether the rest of the investment has been fully allocated. Floatstreet will also invest in this Short Term Note offering alongside its investors and take a first loss position, ultimately demonstrating its alignment of interests with investors.</p>
					<p class="overview-2">Since January 2018, Yieldstreet has been prefunding offerings via a warehouse financing facility before they launch on the platform, and over $1.4B has been financed to date through this prefunding program. This note functions in the same way as the warehouse financing facility, as it allows Yieldstreet to access additional capital to prefund more offerings. The Short Term Notes Series is an established workflow, and Yieldstreet has provided its investor community the opportunity to earn yield through Short Term Note offerings launched at a cadence since May 2019.


Yieldstreet investors are scheduled to receive interest payments on a monthly basis at a target annualized target interest rate of 3.5% over the course of 3 months.</p>
