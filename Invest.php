                    <h6>Overview</h6>
                    <p>FloatStreet is pleased to offer a short-term liquidity product earning investors annualized target interest payments
                        of 3.5% over its 90-day term. FloatStreet offers a potential mutual advantage to both originators and investors
                        by fully prefunding upcoming offerings that will launch on the FloatStreet platform.From the originatorâ€™s perspective
                        ,prefunding helps to eliminate execution risk for the transaction as 100% of funds are available at the time of closing.
                        For investors, prefunding an investment offering means that any participating investors can begin to earn interest as 
                        soon as their allocation goes active, regardless of whether the rest of the investment has been fully allocated.
